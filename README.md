# Airtime-Africas Talking
This is a simple python script to send airtime
### Task
- Write a program that reads a csv file. The csv file contains 3
columns; employee_name, employee_phone_number, airtime_amount
   - The program should use the
AfricasTalking(https://developers.africastalking.com/docs/airtime/sending)
airtime API to send
     airtime to each employee. Each employee should receive airtime
equivalent to what is indicated in the csv file.
   - Write well commented code.
   - The program/project should also be well documented.
   - The code should also have some tests.
   - Note:
       1. You can use any programming language that you want.
       2. You can ONLY use/import libraries/packages that come from
the standard library of the programming language of your choice.
          You should not use any other third party libraries.
       3. Use the csv file called xyz_employees.csv(that is attached
to this email) for the task.
       4. We DO NOT expect you to actually sign-up to AfricasTalking
for you to complete this task.
          If you would like to, that is okay; but you are not expected to.
       5. This challenge should not cost you any money(see point 4 above)
       6. Ideally, this task should take a few hours.
